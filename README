# YOLOv8- Based Helmet and Vest Detection system for Safety Assessment

The YOLOv8-s model was employed, achieving a 99.5% mean average
precision (mAP) accuracy rate in real-time. Implementing this proposed system has the
potential to significantly improve safety practices in the construction industry by enabling
efficient and reliable monitoring of personal protective equipment usage, thus enhancing
overall safety at construction sites.
